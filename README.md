DATA CLEANING AND ETL
## Data Cleaning

Data cleaning is crucial to ensure the accuracy and reliability of our datasets. Here's a quick overview:

- **Duplicate Removal:** Eliminate redundant records.
- **Handling Missing Values:** Strategically manage and fill missing data.
- **Format Standardization:** Ensure consistency in data formats.
- **Error Correction:** Identify and rectify anomalies or outliers.

## ETL Process

Our data pipeline follows the ETL paradigm, facilitating efficient data integration. Here's a breakdown:

### Extract
Retrieve data from diverse sources, capturing relevant information for analysis.

### Transform
Clean, structure, and enrich the data. Apply necessary transformations for meaningful insights.

### Load
Transfer the transformed data to a target database, making it ready for reporting and analysis.
